Tell a story through movement and media.

In this hands-on workshop, you'll explore the intersection of dance and real-time visuals using TouchDesigner, a powerful node-based visual programming tool. Learn how to create interactive visual effects that respond to your body in motion — from feedback loops and edge detection to video and real-time signal processing.

Whether you're a dancer, media artist, or curious creative, this class invites you to move, play, and build immersive environments that transform performance into a visual language. We’ll spend time both moving together and building interactive systems, culminating in the creation of a live installation that reacts in real-time to your presence.

No prior programming or dance experience required, just a willingness to experiment, move, and collaborate.

This workshop was created with the support of DISCO RIOT.
