DISCO RIOT's POP IN/POP OUT series offers master classes to those in our community from trusted teaching artists to promote a culture of sharing, exploration, diversity, expanding perspectives, and building community. Class is a place of personal growth, community building, curiosity, skill-building, and play. We hope to expand our collective experiences by bringing in teaching artists that challenge what we're used to. We learn more from one another. We grow together. Join us!

POP IN/POP OUT classes are on a tiered payment scale of $15, $20, $25 so that we can offer the highest quality experience for the community and for the master teacher. No one is turned away for lack of funds. Please reach out to education@discoriot.org for assistance.

All proceeds from this workshop will support DISCO RIOT's Education & Outreach programming.

This event is ADA accessible. DISCO RIOT is committed to accessibility and holds with great care the needs of our entire community, especially those who are disabled. We encourage you to contact Alyssa Rose, Operations Coordinator and Accessibility Specialist (email: operations@disoriot.org) regarding any specific accommodation needs.

Tell a story through movement and media.

In this hands-on workshop, you'll explore the intersection of dance and real-time visuals using TouchDesigner, a powerful node-based visual programming tool. Learn how to create interactive visual effects that respond to your body in motion — from feedback loops and edge detection to video and real-time signal processing.

Whether you're a dancer, media artist, or curious creative, this class invites you to move, play, and build immersive environments that transform performance into a visual language. We’ll spend time both moving together and building interactive systems, culminating in the creation of a live installation that reacts in real-time to your presence.

No prior programming or dance experience required, just a willingness to experiment, move, and collaborate.

A laptop with TouchDesigner installed (free version is okay)
