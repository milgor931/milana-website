***How can we integrate artistic, scientific, and embodied approaches to understand and engage with intelligence, consciousness, and ecological systems across scales—human, nonhuman, and technological—in ways that transform perception, relationships, and shared futures?***

- How can artistic and scientific methods together reveal intelligence as a multiscale phenomenon, spanning from microbial to cosmic systems?

- In what ways can technology be reframed as an ecological process, embedded within and responsive to Earth’s biosphere and geology? What are the affordances or dangers this might bring?

- How can embodied practices—such as dance, ritual, and sensory interaction—serve as frameworks for exploring and communicating planetary and distributed cognition?

- What artistic, ethical, and cultural forms emerge when humans and machines collaborate as co-creative agents rather than in hierarchical tool–user relationships?

- How can research-based art function as both a mode of inquiry and a perceptual shift, cultivating ecological awareness and kinship across species, systems, and scales?

- What new rituals, aesthetics, and social structures might arise in a society where consciousness and agency are shared across human, nonhuman, and technological participants? What new rituals, aesthetics, and social structures do we want to encourage, or discourage?

- How can we design human–machine interfaces that amplify embodied, ecological, and relational forms of knowing rather than mimic human cognition?

- In what ways can an integrated understanding of artificial intelligence, neuroscience, information theory, systems theory, and the arts (including performance, dance, poetry, and computational media) expand our concepts of perception, consciousness, and free will?

- How might creative experiments with AI and responsive environments influence cultural narratives about sustainability, responsibility, and planetary health?

- What new languages—visual, sonic, poetic—are needed to communicate across diverse intelligences and timescales, and how can these languages shape shared futures? Similarly,  what new senses?

- Can artistic experiments (with AI, computation, and responsive environments) explore different scales of consciousness, for example consciousness meaningfully distributed across human and nonhuman participants in a shared creative act?
