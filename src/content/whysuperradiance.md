When particles (e.g. atoms, molecules) are excited (e.g. with light), they enter a higher energy state. After a while, they release that energy, typically by emitting light. This is what we call fluorescence (or phosphorescence, depending on the specific process). Normally, each particle acts independently, emitting at random times. The emissions are uncoordinated, so the light waves interfere both constructively and destructively, and the **overall intensity scales linearly** with the number of particles (e.g. 10× particles → 10× brightness).

In some special situations, if all the particles are in **quantum coherence**, their internal oscillations are **phase-aligned and they behave like a single system. They act collectively, perfectly in sync**. The emitted waves interfere purely constructively, fully reinforcing each other. Now the **intensity grows quadratically** with the number of particles (e.g. 10× particles → 100× brightness), producing a super-bright burst of light. This is **Superradiance**.
