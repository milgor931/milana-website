In 'She Speaks', I explore my own journey with the ideal of perfection and the path towards self-acceptance.

The piece begins with the image of an imagined woman—a figure I once believed to be the embodiment of perfection. She was everything I thought I needed to be: beautiful, kind, strong, and flawless in every way. For a long time, I was captivated by this ideal, striving to mold myself into her image.

As I grew up, the pressure to be perfect became overwhelming. I tried to live up to impossible standards, constantly pushing myself to be the perfect daughter, student, and person. But as time went on, I started to see the cracks in this pursuit.

The more I chased after perfection, the more I found myself lost in insecurities, self-criticism, and anxiety. My body and mind bore the weight of these unrealistic expectations, and it became clear that this idealized version of myself was not only unattainable but also destructive.

In 'She Speaks', I break free from the chains of perfectionism. Through dance, I reconnect with a different version of myself—one that is wild, playful, and unapologetically authentic.

This piece is a celebration of imperfection, vulnerability, and the beauty that comes from embracing who I truly am. As I move, I let go of the need to be flawless and allow myself to be messy, real, and human. This dance is my way of showing that there is immense power in being true to oneself. It’s about finding beauty in the rawness of life and realizing that we don’t have to be perfect to be worthy of love and acceptance.

'She Speaks' is my journey towards self-acceptance, and it’s an invitation for others to embrace their own imperfections and live authentically.

I initially performed "She Speaks" at Out of the Box: A Movement Open-Mic I produced in the spring of 2024.
