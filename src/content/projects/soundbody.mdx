S O U N D B O D Y is the culmination of my 10-week research exploring cymatics—the study of making sound waves visible—within the body. Over time, this curiosity of how sound moves me evolved into the development of movement scores that recognize the body first as matter, second as a collection of moving particles and finally, as an expression of energy experiencing itself through sensation through a dance of space, sound, and time. At its core, this work is a study in experiential boundlessness and learning to expand the body and consciousness beyond the physical scope to recognize oneself as non-separate from the whole energetic ecosystem that we as alive beings move, breathe, and dream within.
