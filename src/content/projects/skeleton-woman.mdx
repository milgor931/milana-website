A media art piece inspired by the story of “Skeleton Woman” as told by Clarissa Pinkola Estés in the book, Women Who Run With the Wolves. In my own story and understanding, this story carries the message that the more we struggle with the Life/Death/Life (language of Clarissa Pinkola Estés) cycle, the more entangled we become in ourselves and it takes great compassion and care to become untangled and whole again.
