'Destroy the Sociarchy' is a contemporary and explorative dance piece created around the concept of how we move is what we make by my great teacher, Eric Geiger. The piece explores what happens when we break free from the judgments and stop conforming to the expectations of society.

It is a celebration of individuality and diversity that asks the question of “will they still love me if they see me for who I am?”

Often there’s a fear of standing out and being perceived as “weird” but in truth, when we allow ourselves to embrace our authenticity and express it fully, it allows others to come as they are and express their truest selves as well.

It was created in early 2024 and performed on March 12, 2024. It was performed at Out of the Box, a dance open mic show I created, at the Lightbox Theater in Liberty Station in San Diego.
