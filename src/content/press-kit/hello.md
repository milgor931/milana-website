### My work lives at the intersection of performance, technology, and the body.

<br />

I am fascinated by questions around **embodiment, memory, quantum states of feeling, and our imperfect humanity.** I’m especially drawn to the tension between the mechanical and the organic, the controlled and the chaotic, the performed and the authentic. Through this, I aim to create spaces where audiences can feel something not just intellectually, but viscerally. 

As a **movement artist and creative technologist**, I create experiences that bridge the sensorial and the digital—where somatic intelligence, improvisation, and real-time media weave together into living systems of expression. 

Ultimately, I want my work to **dissolve boundaries—between disciplines**, between the internal and external, and between artist and viewer. I believe in art as an invitation: to feel more, to sense more, and to remember the strange, **beautiful complexity of being alive**.
