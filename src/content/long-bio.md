Milana Aernova is an interdisciplinary artist and creative technologist who sculpts experiences at the intersection of movement, performance, and technology. With a foundation in diverse movement styles and computer science, she creates real-time environments using tools like TouchDesigner and camera-based interaction. Her work explores embodiment, the laws of physics, and humanityâ€™s evolving relationship with the modern world. She is particularly drawn to the juxtaposition between artificial and organic as well as mover and witness. She aims to dissolve boundaries between disciplines and interior/exterior worlds, inviting audiences to experience the unknowable complexity of being alive through the synthesis of digital and physical expression.
