It’s one thing to intellectually know that we are deeply entangled within complex, interdependent networks and assemblages of life, composed of and embedded within expansive scales of intelligence, unfolding across boundaries of self—an intelligent universe. 

It’s one thing to intellectually **know** this, but how can we **feel** it, in our bodies?

Our practice weaves together **ancient biotechnologies** like **poetry**, **dance, and ritual,** with **AI**, **simulations**, and **code**—combining **computational media** with **scientific research** to create works that explore our understandings of **consciousness**, **multi-scale cognition** and **ecological awareness** through felt knowledge. Responding to the severance brought on by modernity, and working toward reconnection to the living world, we employ technological mediation as a means of exploring embodied experience rather than escaping it.

Our work ranges from large-scale responsive installations and performances to online interventions and publications.
